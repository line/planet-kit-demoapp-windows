If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>

<p>4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:</p>

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.</p>

<p>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

<p>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>

<p>Introduction&nbsp;</p>

<p>The FreeType Project is distributed in several archive packages; some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine, various tools and contributions which rely on, or relate to, the FreeType Project.</p>

<p>This license applies to all files found in such packages, and which do not fall under their own explicit license. The license affects thus the FreeType font engine, the test programs, documentation and makefiles, at the very least.</p>

<p>This license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG (Independent JPEG Group) licenses, which all encourage inclusion and use of free software in commercial and freeware products alike. As a consequence, its main points are that:</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;o We don&#39;t promise that this software works. However, we will be interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is&#39; distribution)</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;o You can use this software for whatever you want, in parts or full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free&#39; usage)</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;o You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it, or only parts of it, in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you have used the FreeType code. (`credits&#39;)</p>

<p>We specifically permit and encourage the inclusion of this software, with or without modifications, in commercial products. We disclaim all warranties covering The FreeType Project and assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, many people asked us for a preferred form for a credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license. We thus encourage you to use the following text:</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;&quot;&quot; Portions of this software are copyright &copy; &lt;year&gt; The FreeType Project (www.freetype.org). All rights reserved. &quot;&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>Please replace &lt;year&gt; with the value from the FreeType version you actually use.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Legal Terms&nbsp;</p>

<p>0. Definitions&nbsp;</p>

<p>Throughout this license, the terms `package&#39;, `FreeType Project&#39;, and `FreeType archive&#39; refer to the set of files originally distributed by the authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project&#39;, be they named as alpha, beta or final release.</p>

<p>`You&#39; refers to the licensee, or person using the project, where `using&#39; is a generic term including compiling the project&#39;s source code as well as linking it to form a `program&#39; or `executable&#39;. This program is referred to as `a program using the FreeType engine&#39;.</p>

<p>This license applies to all files distributed in the original FreeType Project, including all source code, binaries and documentation, unless otherwise stated in the file in its original, unmodified form as distributed in the original archive. If you are unsure whether or not a particular file is covered by this license, you must contact us to verify this.</p>

<p>The FreeType Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000 by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg. All rights reserved except as specified below.</p>

<p>1. No Warranty&nbsp;</p>

<p>THE FREETYPE PROJECT IS PROVIDED `AS IS&#39; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.</p>

<p>2. Redistribution</p>

<p>This license grants a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable right and license to use, execute, perform, compile, display, copy, create derivative works of, distribute and sublicense the FreeType Project (in both source and object code forms) and derivative works thereof for any purpose; and to authorize others to exercise some or all of the rights granted herein, subject to the following conditions:</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;o Redistribution of source code must retain this license file (`FTL.TXT&#39;) unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation. The copyright notices of the unaltered, original files must be preserved in all copies of source files.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;o Redistribution in binary form must provide a disclaimer that states that the software is based in part of the work of the FreeType Team, in the distribution documentation. We also encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page in your documentation, though this isn&#39;t mandatory.</p>

<p>These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the FreeType Project, not just the unmodified files. If you use our work, you must acknowledge us. However, no fee need be paid to us.</p>

<p>3. Advertising&nbsp;</p>

<p>Neither the FreeType authors and contributors nor you shall use the name of the other for commercial, advertising, or promotional purposes without specific prior written permission.</p>

<p>We suggest, but do not require, that you use one or more of the following phrases to refer to this software in your documentation or advertising materials: `FreeType Project&#39;, `FreeType Engine&#39;, `FreeType library&#39;, or `FreeType Distribution&#39;.</p>

<p>As you have not signed this license, you are not required to accept it. However, as the FreeType Project is copyrighted material, only this license, or another one contracted with the authors, grants you the right to use, distribute, and modify it. Therefore, by using, distributing, or modifying the FreeType Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms of this license.</p>

<p>4. Contacts&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;o freetype@nongnu.org</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as future and wanted additions to the library and distribution. If you are looking for support, start in this list if you haven&#39;t found anything to help you in the documentation.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;o freetype-devel@nongnu.org</p>

<p>LEGAL ISSUES&nbsp;</p>

<p>In plain English:</p>

<p>1. We don&#39;t promise that this software works. (But if you find any bugs, please let us know!)&nbsp;<br />
2. You can use this software for whatever you want. You don&#39;t have to pay us.&nbsp;<br />
3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you&#39;ve used the IJG code.</p>

<p>In legalese:</p>

<p>The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied, with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose. This software is provided &quot;AS IS&quot;, and you, its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.</p>

<p>This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane. All Rights Reserved except as specified below.</p>

<p>Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these conditions: &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation must state that &quot;this software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group&quot;.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.</p>

<p>These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code, not just to the unmodified library. If you use our work, you ought to acknowledge us.</p>

<p>Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author&#39;s name or company name in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from it. This software may be referred to only as &quot;the Independent JPEG Group&#39;s software&quot;.</p>

<p>We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are assumed by the product vendor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally, that you must include source code if you redistribute it. (See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.) However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do.</p>

<p>The Unix configuration script &quot;configure&quot; was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltconfig, ltmain.sh). Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.</p>

<p>It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by patents owned by IBM, AT&amp;T, and Mitsubishi. Hence arithmetic coding cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses. For this reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software. (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.) So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining code.</p>

<p>The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce &quot;uncompressed GIFs&quot;. This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.</p>

<p>We are required to state that&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

OFL-1.1</p>

<p><br />
SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE</p>

<p>Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007</p>

<p>PREAMBLE&nbsp;</p>

<p>The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.</p>

<p>The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.</p>

<p>DEFINITIONS&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Font Software&quot; refers to the set of files released by the Copyright Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may include source files, build scripts and documentation.</p>

<p>&quot;Reserved Font Name&quot; refers to any names specified as such after the copyright statement(s).</p>

<p>&quot;Original Version&quot; refers to the collection of Font Software components as distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).</p>

<p>&quot;Modified Version&quot; refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting, or substituting &mdash; in part or in whole &mdash; any of the components of the Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a new environment.</p>

<p>&quot;Author&quot; refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.</p>

<p>PERMISSION &amp; CONDITIONS&nbsp;</p>

<p>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify, redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font Software, subject to the following conditions:</p>

<p>1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components, in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.</p>

<p>2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled, redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.</p>

<p>3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as presented to the users.</p>

<p>4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written permission.</p>

<p>5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the Font Software.</p>

<p>TERMINATION&nbsp;</p>

<p>This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are not met.</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER&nbsp;</p>

<p>THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR FROM OTHER DEALINGS IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.</p>
